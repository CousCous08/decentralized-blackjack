# Decentralized Blackjack!

This is an infinite card blackjack application built on top of a smart contract deployed onto the Sui Blockchain! Find the smart contract in move/blackjack/build/sources/single_player_blackjack.move

I'm currently testing a UI for this game. However, you can play the game using the sui client CLI! Check out this link for more information:

# Why build BJ on the blockchain?

The most important reason for using blockchain to store all game states is so that the probabilties of each card are verifiable. By storing data on an immutable and public database such as blockchain, any independent party can verify the true randomness and ensure the house is not cheating!
